                And the research and development work still goes on, with new operating systems being developed and existing ones being improved to enhance the overall user experience while making operating systems fast and efficient like they have never been before<br/>
                <b>Symmetric multiprocessing</b><br/>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Allows for several CPUs to process multiple jobs at the same time. CPUs are independent of one another, but each has access &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the operating system.
                <br/><b>Asymmetric multiprocessing</b><br/>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Some operating systems functions are assigned to subordinate processors, which take their instructions from the main CPU.
                <b>Distributed processing</b><br/>
                &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Processors are placed at remote locations and are connected to each other via telecom devices. Different from symmetric multiprocessing systems as they do not share memory. Computations can be dispersed among several processors

            <b>Resource Allocation</b><br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;•	Multiple users or jobs require that resources be allocated to each one.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;•	Some resources have a special allocation code, while others may have more general request and release code.<br/>
            <b>Protection and Security</b><br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;•	It should not be possible for one process to interfere with other processes or the OS itself.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;•	This means that all access to system resources is controlled.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;•	Protecting the system from outside threats is done through authenticating users, and to defending external I/O devices.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;•	Log files can help detect and track attempts of outside infiltration.<br/>
